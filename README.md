A life long learner, I enjoy challenging tasks that push the limits of my knowledge and skill sets. I am particularly motivated by projects that promote the commonweal of society and improve the public's understanding of computer science issues. Historically, I have focused on the intersections of technology, politics, and social advancement, though I am currently focused more on technical coding than social awareness of computer science concerns.
